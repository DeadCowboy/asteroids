CSS TRANSFORMS
I was just trying to get going on this again and found that
my CSS transforms scripts weren't working.  I have fixed 
them now.

For FireFox, checking for 'transform' in the element's style
object will return true, but it doesn't work.  Had to change
the array so that 'transform' comes last, that way it will
default to 'MozTransform' for FireFox.

Chrome won't work with matrix transforms specified in pixels
'px'.  So, I need to remove those strings from the matrix
string in the 'updateTransform' method.
