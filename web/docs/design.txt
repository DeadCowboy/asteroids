GAMEPLAY
Asteroids is based of the simple arcade game from Atari in 1979.  The player
controls a space ship by press the left/right arrow keys to rotate the ship, and
press up to control thrust.  Pressing the space bar fires the ships lasers.

The player must avoid asteroids, if the collide with the ship it, then the 
player will lose a life.  Once all lives have been lost, the player loses the
game.  Shooting the asteroids with the laser will cause them to break apart from
larger to smaller asteroids.  Small asteroids vaporize when hit by the laser.
Successfully hitting asteroids adds to the player's score.

The game is set on a single non-scrolling screen.  Game objects wrap when they 
go off screen.

A Flash version of the game can be found here:

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
The ultimate goal of this project is to learn more about specific HTML5 
technologies and become more familiar with their advantages and limitaions.

CSS Transformations
All positioning, rotation, and scaling of game objects will be handled by CSS.

HTML5 Audio
All audio and sound effects will be handled by HTML5 audio.  There's potential
to explore a Flash fallback for audio to support legacy browsers.

Local Storage
The player's top 10 high scores will be stored in their local cache.  Could be
expanded to allow to show player's replays.

Application Cache
The game shall be available for offline line play by utilizing the application
cache manifest.


SECONDARY OBJECTIVES
The following goals are features that may or may not be added once the primary
goals have been completed.

CSS Animation
Add a parallax scrolling background to the game use CSS3 animations.

CSS Drawing
Instead of using bitmaps for game objects, use CSS3 drawing techniques.

Full Screen
Allow the game to go full screen, using browser's full screen API.

Geolocation
Get the user's geolocation and have that represented in the game in some way,
perhaps by overlaying the game on a Google map.

Mobile Support
Add mobile detection and swap keyboard controls for touch/gesture controls.

Vector Graphics
Instead of using bitmaps for the game objects, use SVG or similar technologies
for displaying graphics as vectors.
