MASKING
I was able to mask objects within the game, without using the new CSS3 masks,
by setting the container element to overflow:hidden.

CSS TRANSFORMS
I want to do as much with CSS as I can for this project.  I've managed to get
CSS transforms working very well in Mozilla.  At first I tried just setting
the transform rotation with 'rotate(Ndeg)', but as I want to do other
transforms such as scaling I found I really need to do matrices.

This wasn't as difficult as I thought after finding some math help through
WikiPedia.  So, rotation, scaling, and translation (soon) is in the game.

CSS ANIMATIONS
I found out that you can't doing background-image animations in CSS outside
of Chrome.  So, I've decide to try and use a sprite sheet and change the
background-position instead.  This seems to be working good for now.

JAVASCRIPT
Lots and lots and lots of learning how to do OOP in JavaScript.  I find it 
difficult since it requires a great amount of code discipline to keep your
design pattern consistent.

JavaScript does not support classes, only prototype.  In a project like this
you really need classes and inheritance.  There are many many ways to hack 
this out in JavaScript so that you can have a constructor, super, etc and
be able to extend properly.  I've modeled my pattern after the one used in
THREE.js as it's very obvious and plain to understand how it works.
